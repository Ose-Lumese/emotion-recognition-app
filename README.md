# Real-Time Face Emotion Recognition Web Application

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to perform real-time emotion recognition from user-uploaded images. The application is built using Flask for the web interface and TensorFlow/Keras for the machine learning backend.

The model is trained on facial images categorized into seven basic emotions. All prediction results are logged to a local SQLite database (database.db).
